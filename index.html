			<h1>Maarten Waegeman</h1>

			<h2>Web-Developer <span class="subheadline">and generally curious being</span></h2>
			<p>
				I am a 29 year young individual from Opwijk in Belgium (close to Brussels). After finishing my studies in Applied Computer Sciences, I started my career as a Technical consultant.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the past I have worked on projects for large organisations in both public and private sector, mostly in large teams. But I have also been part of a tight small team for a startup. The biggest kick, I get from finding the best soltution to a problem and I am not scared of trying out new technologies. I am always keen on learning new things and I get things under my belt rather quickly.
			</p>
			<p class="extramargin">
				I enjoy life and love to be around family and friends. I have a positive attitude and I enjoy a good joke once in a while although I am serious and professional when it counts. In my free time I enjoy reading, playing the trumpet and watching a good movie.
