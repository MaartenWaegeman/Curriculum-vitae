# HTML Curriculum vitae
I have made quite a few CVs in MS Word over the years and despite spending quite some time in Word, I can't say I have made many outstanding CVs with it. I found myself lacking the control over my layout and felt frustrated sometimes with inconsistent styles.

I wished more than once that I was as good with Word as with HTML and CSS. When I found a tool to easily convert an HTML document to a PDF I was sold right away. Finally I could use more complex layouts without effort and apply all the CSS tricks I've learned over the years to craft a much better CV!

# This reposititory
In this repository you can find the styles and the HTML document I use to generate my CV in PDF format.

# Tool
To convert my cv from an HTML to a PDF file I use Snappy (https://github.com/KnpLabs/snappy), a PHP wrapper for [wkhtmltopdf and wkhtmltoimage](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) to generate a PDF from a url or a html page.
